# badbank
This is my badbank project where I have built a front-end banking application. This application allows users to create and login to their account and also allows users to deposit,withdraw and view their own balance.

I plan to build a backend for this application so that users who use this app can have their data stored.

To use this application use this link: http://narenbadbank.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com and you will able to use this application and you will be able to use all of the create,login,withdraw and deposit functionality of my front-end app.
